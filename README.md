# Project Name

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itzaRinna/JM_002.git
   

2. **Navigate to the source folder:**
   Move into the project directory where the source code resides:
   ```bash
   cd JM_002/source

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
   This will install the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Development

To start the development environment, run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev


This command will:

- Start a local development server (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`).
- Enable hot reloading, so any changes you make to the source files will automatically refresh the browser.

## Additional Notes

- If you're using a code editor like **VSCode**, make sure to install the necessary extensions for TypeScript and React to get full IntelliSense support.
- If you encounter any issues during installation or development, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.


You can customize or expand the file structure based on your needs.

## Usage

Once the development environment is set up, you can:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.
2. Start editing the JavaScript code inside the `source/js` folder.
3. Make changes to HTML and CSS files as needed to improve your UI.

If you have integrated APIs or additional functionality, feel free to modify and add them.

### Running Tests

If you have tests set up for the project, you can run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite (if set up) and display the results in the terminal.
